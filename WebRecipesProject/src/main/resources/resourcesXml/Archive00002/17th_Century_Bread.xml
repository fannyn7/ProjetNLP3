      <step>  Stir the sugar into the water. Sprinkle in the yeast.  Let the mixture
  stand until the yeast bubbles to the surface.  Stir in the white
  flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour. Mix well.  Cover the batter with
  waxed paper and a towel. Let it sit until it is bubbly, 30 minutes to
        1    hour.
  
  Stir down the batter, and add the salt, the rye flour and the corn
  flour.
  
  Spread the remaining 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour over a work
  surface, and turn the dough onto it. Knead the wheat flour into the
  dough, sprinkling with more white flour if the dough is still too
  sticky. Knead until the dough is firm but springy.
  
  Grease a clean bowl with the vegetable oil. Set the dough in the
  bowl, and turn the dough over to coat it completely with the oil.
  Cover the dough with waxed paper and a towel, and set it to rise
  until it is double in bulk, about 1 hour, or overnight in the
  refridgerator.
  
  Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
  
  Punch down the dough, and divide in two. Knead it into two round
  loaves. With a sharp knife, cut a slash around the circumference of
  each loaf and prick the top. Set the loaves on a lightly floured
  cookie sheet. The dough need not rise again for baking.
  
  Bake the bread for 45 minutes, or until a tap on the bottom of the
  loaf produces a hollow sound. Set the loaves on racks to cool.
