      <step>  Preparation time: 25 minutes Cooking time: 20 to 25 minutes
  
   1. Cream butter and sugar in large mixer bowl until light and fluffy. Beat
  in flour and salt. Knead the dough briefly until smooth. If dough is too
  sticky, add a bit more flour. (Dough can be refrigerated up to several
  days; soften slightly before shaping cookies.)
  
   2. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.
  
   3. Pat half of the dough out on lightly floured surface to 1/2 -inch
  thickness. Use cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes. Place cookies 2
  inches apart on baking sheets. Bake until light brown on edges, 20 to 25
  minutes. Cool on wire racks.
   Note: The sheep cookie cutter used by Koenig is a Hallmark cutter that is
  no longer available. A sheep pattern can be made out of cardboard and
  placed over dough; cut out the shape with a small knife.
  
   Third prize went to Betty J. Koenig, of Hammond, Ind., for her recipe for
  shortbread cookies in the shape of sheep. Betty uses a sheep cookie cutter
  to make these cookies. She suggests using your fingertips to dimple the
  dough to resemble their wooly coats. If desired, a small piece of chocolate
  can be used for eyes after baking. Chicago Tribune, December 13, 1990 from
  the Chicago Tribune third annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest
