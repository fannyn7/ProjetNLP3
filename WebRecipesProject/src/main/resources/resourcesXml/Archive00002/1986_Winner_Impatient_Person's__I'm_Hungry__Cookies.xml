    Winner Jeanette McCarthy, Downers Grove, Illinois, describes her
  impatient person's "I'm hungry" cookies: "When I was a child, part of our
  Christmas celebration involved visits to my father's relatives during the
  time between Christmas and Epiphany. Great-Aunt Elizabeth came from a
  family whose women had been cooks for a wealthy family in Hungary. As a
  result, her cooking was usually slightly different and somewhat elegant.
  
    "A treasured memory of Christmas at Great-Aunt Elizabeth's house was a
  cookie that I never learned to eat in moderation. Although my mother warned
  me not to say anything, one of the first things I would say upon arrival
  was, 'I'm hungry,' hoping that these cookies would appear. Much to my
  delight they usually did, and in fact, began also to appear at Easter, the
  Fourth of July, Thanksgiving and any other time we got together to
  celebrate." from the Chicago Tribune annual Food Guide Holiday Cookie
