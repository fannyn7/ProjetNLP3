      <step>  The 2nd place winner in the Chicago Tribune's 1996 Annual Holiday Cookie
  Contest, a simple brown-sugar shortbread from Sandra Petrille of
  Naperville, Illinois.
  
  1. Heat oven to 325'F. Beat all ingredients in large bowl of electric mixer
  on medium-high speed until smooth, about 4 minutes.
  
  2. Divide dough into 4 pieces. Roll out 1 piece of dough at a time on
  lightly floured surface to 1/16- to 1/8-inch thickness. Cut out dough with
  cookie cutters.
  
  3. Bake cookies on ungreased baking sheet until pale brown and slightly
  firm to the touch, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove to cooling rack. Decorate as
  desired.
