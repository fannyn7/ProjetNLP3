      <step>  Preparation time: 30 minutes Chilling time: 8 hours or overnight Cooking
  time: 10 minutes
  
   1. Cream butter and sugar in large mixer bowl of electric mixer. Beat in
  eggs, one at a time. Beat in lemon rind and juice. Mix flour, baking powder
  and salt. Stir flour mixture and ground almonds into butter mixture to make
  a soft dough. Divide dough into quarters. Refrigerate dough, wrapped in wax
  paper, until firm, at least 8 hours or overnight.
  
   2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have ungreased baking sheets ready.
  
   3. Roll out one dough portion on lightly floured pastry cloth with a
  rolling pin covered with stocking or roll between sheets of lightly floured
  wax paper to 1/8 -inch thickness. Cut out with cookie cutters. Return dough
  to refrigerator if it gets too soft. Transfer to baking sheets, leaving 2
  inches between each cookie. Sprinkle with colored sugar if desired.
  
   4. Bake until very light brown at edges, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to wire
  racks to cool. Store in a covered tin.
  
   This second-place winner, from Judy M. Drux of Dyer, Indiana, makes very
  thin, crisp, delicate cookies. The dough keeps well in the refrigerator if
  well-wrapped. This cookie was a tribute to her husband's grandmother,
  Antonia Drux, who emigrated to this country from Germany in 1923. (Oma
  means "grandma" in German.) The recipe has been passed down as just a list
  of ingredients. Drux added a few hints to help make baking them easier for
  future cooks. from the Chicago Tribune fourth annual Food Guide Holiday
