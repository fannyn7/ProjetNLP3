      <step>  Preparation time: 30 minutes Chilling time: 2 to 3 hours Cooking time: 7 to
        8    minutes
  
   1. Cream butter, sugar, egg, vanilla and almond extract in large mixer
  bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in flour, baking soda and cream of tartar
  until mixed. Divide dough in half. Cover and refrigerate dough 2 to 3
  hours. (Dough can be refrigerated up to several days; soften slightly
  before rolling out.)
  
   2. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Have lightly greased baking sheets ready.
  
   3. Roll out half of dough on lightly floured surface to almost 1/4 ~inch
  thick. Use cookie cutters to cut out desired shapes. Place cookies 2 inches
  apart on prepared baking sheets. Bake until light brown on edges, 7 to 8
  minutes. Cool on wire racks.
  
   4. For frosting, beat cream cheese, sugar and vanilla in small bowl until
  smooth. Beat in milk until spreading consistency. Add food coloring as
  desired.
  
   5. Use frosting to decorate cookies. Let stand until frosting sets.
  
   Second place went to Nancy Rullo, of Bloomingdale, for her recipe for
  Mom's sugar cookies in the shape of Santa Claus faces, iced with a cream
  cheese frosting and decorated in traditional holiday colors. The recipe,
  Rullo wrote, was one that her mother had found in her mother's first
  cookbook. As children, Rullo and her brother would help cut out the Santa
  Claus shapes and watch them bake. from the Chicago Tribune third annual
  Food Guide Holiday Cookie Contest December 13, 1990
