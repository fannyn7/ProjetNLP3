      <step>   Preparation time: 40 minutes Standing time: 1 hour plus overnight Cooking
  time: 10 to 12 minutes Aging time: 1 week or more
  
   1. Mash baker's ammonia with a rolling pin if it is not powdered. Dissolve
  it in the milk in a small bowl and let stand 1 hour before using.
  
   2. Beat eggs in large bowl of electric mixer until thick and
  lemon-colored, about 5 minutes. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar
  until creamy and smooth. Add butter and beat again until creamy. Add anise
  oil, dissolved baker's ammonia and salt; beat to mix. Gradually beat in
  enough flour to make a stiff dough.
  
   3. Cut off pieces of dough and work in more flour on a floured work
  surface until dough is stiff enough to roll out and hold the design of the
  springerle rolling pin or mold. Roll out on a lightly floured board with a
  floured rolling pin to 1/4-inch thickness. Press design on dough with a
  floured springerle rolling pin or mold. Cut cookies apart using a floured
  knife. Leave on work surface covered with a clean kitchen towel overnight.
  
   4. The next day, heat oven to 325 degrees. Bake cookies on greased baking
  sheets, until barely golden on the bottom, 10 to 12 minutes.
   Cool on wire racks. Store in tightly covered tins and allow to mellow at
  least 1 week before serving.
  
   Note: This recipe also can be made using 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder (in
  place of the milk and the baker's ammonia) and anise extract instead of
  anise oil. However, the cookies will not be as delicately textured and the
  anise flavor not quite as rich. If using baking powder, add it with the
  salt to the batter.
  
   Connie Meisinger of Buffalo Grove tied for third place with this recipe.
