      <step>   1. Beat butter and granulated sugar in large bowl of electric mixer until
  light and fluffy. Slowly add flour and blend well. Remove from bowl and
  knead until shiny. Divide dough in half; wrap in wax paper. Refrigerate
  dough until it is firm enough to roll, several hours or longer. Let dough
  soften slightly on counter if too firm to roll.
  
   2. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Roll dough between two sheets of floured wax
  paper or flatten dough with floured hands to 1/4-inch thickness on a
  floured surface. Use cookie cutters to make shapes. Transfer to ungreased
  baking sheets. Bake only until slightly golden, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool on
  cookie sheets just long enough to firm cookies and then remove to wire
  racks to cool completely.
  
   3. To assemble, spread half of the cookies with a small amount of jam and
  sandwich with another cookie. Put confectioners' sugar into a small bowl
  and drizzle in just enough milk to make a thin glaze. Frost cookies lightly
  with the glaze and sprinkle with colored sugar. Let stand until glaze
  hardens.
