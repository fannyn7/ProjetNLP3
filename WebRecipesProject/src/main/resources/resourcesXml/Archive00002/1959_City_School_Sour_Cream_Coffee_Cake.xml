    By: Rose Dosti, L.A. Times, Culinary SOS, in response to, "If I were
  dying, I would want the coffee cake served in the junior and senior high
  schools in Los Angeles as my last meal. Do you, by chance, have the
  recipe?"
    Rose responded, "Our sentiments exactly. Here's the recipe as provided by
  the Los Angeles Unified School District archives. As a matter of record,
  the sour cream coffee cake has been served in city school cafeterias since
  1959."
