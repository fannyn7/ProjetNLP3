      <step>  Preparation time: 30 minutes Chilling time: 1 hour
  
  1. Melt butter in saucepan. Remove from heat. Add sugar, coconut and milk.
  Mix well. Shape rounded teaspoon of mixture into balls. Make a dent in the
  center. Place on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper.
  
  2. Fill center with melted chocolate. Chill until firm. Store in
  refrigerator. These freeze wonderfully and look beautiful on a tray.
  
  Winner Shere Case of Hickory Hills describes her cookie entry: "Holiday
  preparation usually starts in September and continues until the night
  before Christmas.  I have been doing this for almost 18 years, and each
  year I add more recipes. This particular cookie, passed on to me by my
  sister- in-law, Diana Forkash of Wisconsin, ranks among the favorites of
  the family and friends. It looks absolutely gorgeous on a plate, tastes
  wonderful and is  absolutely the easiest thing to make. There is no baking
  time involved, and you can sit down on the job and enjoy doing them."
