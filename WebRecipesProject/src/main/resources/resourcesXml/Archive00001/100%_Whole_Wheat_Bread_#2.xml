  This is pretty heavy bread, but I like it that way. For a better raise, try
  adding 1/3 cup of gluten, and you may need a bit more water, then.
  
  Use Whole Wheat mode. Timer ok.
  
  Note: Whole wheat varies greatly in how much water it absorbs. The amounts
  of water shown are the ones that work for me. Check on the dough after the
  first few minutes of kneading. If it is too thin, add flour, 1 T at the
  time. If the dough is too dry and does not form a smooth ball, add water, 1
  T at the time. Since bread machines can handle relatively moist do, it is
  better to err on the moist side (which will result in heavier bread, if it
  is much too much).
