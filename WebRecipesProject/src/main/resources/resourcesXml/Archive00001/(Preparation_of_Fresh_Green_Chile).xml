      <step>  1. Rinse and dry chile. Prick chile with the tines of a fork to allow for
  release of steam.
  
  2. Place chile on a cookie sheet 4-6 inches below the broiling element.
  Turn chile frequently until it is uniformly blistered.
  
  3. Remove chile from the broiler and cover with a damp towel for 10
  minutes.
  
  4. Proceed with one of the steps below:
  
  a) When cooled -- package chiles in a freezer-weight container, seal - --
  and freeze for later use.
  
  b) Remove the outer skin and freeze as in step A.
  
  c) Remove outer skin -- stem, and seeds.Chop and use in any recipe.
  
  d) Remove outer skin and leave chile whole -- drying, for freezing or use
  in a recipe.

  Formatted by Badams who never pricks the peppers and who always removes
  skins/seeds prior to freezing them. (Frozen ones are not as plump and nice
  as fresh, by the way. IMHO -- they are for desparate times.)
