  I feel it is my personal responsibility to let everyone in the world know
  about my 10-minute lasagna.  It requires no boiling of noodles  and you can
  cook it in a fleishig oven because the pan is tightly sealed  ( at least
  according to my understanding).
  
  In an aluminum lasagna tin, layer as follows:
  
        2    layers of lasagna noodles
  
    sauce
  
    cottage cheese
  
    sauce
  
        1    layer of lasagna noodles
  
    American cheese
  
    sauce
  
    rest of lasagna noodles
  
    sauce
  
  Pour 2 cups of water over the whole thing.  Courage! It will look terrible.
  Put a sheet of tin foil over it and tightly seal it.  Bake in a 425 degree
  oven for about 1 hour.  Let it rest before cutting it so it will not fall
  apart.
  
  That's it.  You may make any additions you wish.  I have added vegetables
  and different seasonings according to my mood and what I find in the
  pantry, but it is very acceptable to children plain.
